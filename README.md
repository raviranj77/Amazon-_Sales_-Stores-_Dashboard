Amazon Sales Store Power BI Project
This Power BI project analyzes the sales data of an Amazon store to identify trends and patterns that can inform business decisions. The project includes the following analyses:

Year-wise Profit: Shows the total profit earned by the store each year, allowing the business to track its performance over time.

Sales by Segment: Breaks down the store's sales by customer segment (such as individual, small business, or enterprise) to understand which segments are most profitable.

Sales by Market: Shows the store's sales in different markets (such as North America, Europe, and Asia) to identify where the store is performing well and where there may be untapped opportunities.

Profit by Customer: Analyzes the profit earned from each individual customer, helping the store to identify its most valuable customers and tailor its sales and marketing efforts accordingly.

Bottom 5 Profit by Product: Identifies the least profitable products in the store's inventory, allowing the business to evaluate whether they should be discontinued or re-priced.

Top 5 Profit by Product: Shows the most profitable products in the store's inventory, highlighting which products are driving the majority of the store's revenue.

Data Sources
The data for this project comes from an Amazon sales database that tracks customer orders, products, and sales data. The data was cleaned and processed using Power Query before being loaded into Power BI for analysis.

Data Model
The Power BI model includes tables for orders, products, customers, and sales data, which are linked by common fields such as order ID, customer ID, and product ID. The model also includes calculated columns and measures to perform calculations such as profit margin and year-over-year growth.

Visualizations
The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations to help the business gain insights from the data, including pie charts, donut charts, and stacked column chart,clustered bar chart,map. Key visualizations include:

A pie chart showing sales by segment profit
A Donut chart showing sales by market
A Stacked column chart profit by customer
A Clustered bar chart showing profit by product name
A Map showing region wise sales
Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the business should consider the following recommendations:

Focus on growing sales in the Asia market, which has shown the strongest year-over-year growth
Target small business customers, which have the highest profit margins
Consider discontinuing or re-pricing the least profitable products in the inventory
Develop targeted marketing campaigns to retain and attract the top-performing customers
Future Work
Future work on this project could include incorporating additional data sources such as web analytics or customer feedback, or developing more advanced predictive models to forecast future sales and profitability.
